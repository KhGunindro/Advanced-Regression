## General Information
Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company, is looking to expand its operations into the Australian market. The company specializes in purchasing properties below market value and selling them at a profit. To facilitate its entry into the Australian market, Surprise Housing has collected a dataset containing information on the sale of houses in Australia. The dataset includes various features such as lot size, overall quality and condition of the house, year built, basement square footage, living area square footage, and other relevant details.

The company's objective is to build a regression model using regularization techniques to predict the actual value of prospective properties in Australia. By doing so, Surprise Housing aims to identify potential investment opportunities and make informed decisions about which properties to purchase.

The business goals of the project include:

1. Identifying significant variables that influence the price of houses in the Australian real estate market.
2. Assessing how well these variables can predict the price of a house.
3. Determining the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression, which are regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in regression models.

The following variables have been identified as significant predictors of house prices:
- LotArea: Lot size in square feet
- OverallQual: Rates the overall material and finish of the house
- OverallCond: Rates the overall condition of the house
- YearBuilt: Original construction date
- BsmtFinSF1: Type 1 finished square feet
- TotalBsmtSF: Total square feet of basement area
- GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square feet
- TotRmsAbvGrd: Total rooms above grade (does not include bathrooms)
- Street_Pave: Paved road access to property
- RoofMatl_Metal: Roof material_Metal

These variables will be utilized in the regression model to predict house prices in the Australian market.
